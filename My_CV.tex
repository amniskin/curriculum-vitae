When my professor, Dr. Gary Kalmanovich, told me about Jacopo, a bit about his research, and the internship possiblilty at Blackrock, my interest was piqued. Some people find satisfaction in learning a thing and sticking with it. I am not one of those people. I prefer to live on the edge of my own understanding, constantly venturing further into the unknown. This outlook has resulted in my taking nearly every Math course my alma mater had to offer, and my desire to enter the field of Finance (the undisputed king of the unknown). This preference is not solely a personally beneficial stance, but rather has lead to many workplace improvements.

As an example, I recall one instance from my Army days. For several missions, we would perform our standard communications checks without any issues, but later on in the mission the company would be split into separate ``nets''. Our Commo Sergeant said this was an unavoidable phenomena, which didn't sound reasonable to me. I (a Private at the time) conducted my own investigation. It turns out that these radios use something called ``frequency hop encryption'', which is to say that they change frequency according to a predetermined sequence and the time. The time, however, is the crux. Each time a radio ``que's the mic'', a receiving radio's time is synced to the sender. If, as was the case with us, two radios are separated for a few minutes by a land barrier, it's likely that net will be split due to the random drift. I discovered that this, being a known problem, has a solution and I re-engineered our company radios and we never had that problem again.

I believe my penchant for learning, problem solving, and optimizing things would make me a valuable memember of the team at Blackrock. I realize that to say this will be a challenge would be putting it lightly, but that fact only serves to motivate me further. I am looking forward to many late nights with textbooks and my computer, finding ways to optimize code, etc.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. If you have any questions and or comments, please feel free to contact me at any time.
