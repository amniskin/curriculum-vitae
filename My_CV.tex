I am a first year graduate student in the Data Science program at the New College of Florida. I would like to spend my 2017 summer learning and  Internship with the Analyst Program at BlackRock. As a Mathematician entering the field of statistical computing and Machine Learning, there is no better place to be than Blackrock I believe I have the educational background, academic achievement, and passion to be an outstanding member of your team.

I have previously worked full time as a content developer at XYZ. I was in the Quant team at XYZ where I got to hone my quantitative and analytical skills. As a part of my job I had to constantly communicate with the publishing and marketing team of the company which improved my communication and team leadership skills. In addition, at the University XYZ, I currently taking various courses in Fixed Income, Statistical Modelling, and Portfolio Management where I am learning various financial models and quantitative methods used in the finance industry. I believe that the theoretical and practical knowledge I gained from my graduate program along with my passion to learn new things, will enable me to significantly contribute to your company.

I hope that you will find me well qualified for the Summer Intern Position and I would like to reiterate my strong interest to discuss this opportunity and my qualifications with you further.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
